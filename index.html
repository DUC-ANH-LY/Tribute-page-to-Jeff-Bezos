                Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on January 12, 1964,[16] the son of Jacklyn (née Gise) and Theodore Jørgensen.[17] At the time of Jeffrey's birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student and his father was 19 years old.[18] Theodore Jorgensen had ancestry from Denmark and was born in Chicago to a family of Baptists.[19] After completing high school despite challenging conditions, Jacklyn attended night school while bringing Jeffrey along as a baby.[20] After his parents divorced, his mother married Cuban immigrant Miguel "Mike" Bezos in April 1968.[21] Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jeffrey, whose surname was then legally changed from Jorgensen to Bezos.After Mike had received his degree from the University of New Mexico, the family moved to Houston, Texas, so that he could begin working as an engineer for Exxon.[23] Jeff Bezos attended a Montessori school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he was two years old.[24] Jeff Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[25] Bezos' maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.[26] Gise retired early to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Bezos would spend many summers in his youth.[27] Bezos would later purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117 ha) to 300,000 acres (121,406 ha).[28][29] Bezos displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency, and once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.[30][31] The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School.[32][33] While Bezos was in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.Bezos attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[35][36] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[35] In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[37] In 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a 4.2 GPA and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree (B.S.E.) in electrical engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[38][39] While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[40] In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.
